# Paw Track
PawTrack is a comprehensive pet management application designed to help pet owners keep track of their pets' information, including their location. The app allows users to register their pets, maintain detailed records, and provides a crucial feature for marking pets as lost. If a pet goes missing, anyone who scans the tag on the pet's collar can access the pet's information, notify the owner, and help reunite the pet with its owner.
